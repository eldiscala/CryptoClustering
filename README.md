# CryptoClustering
In this challenge, Python and unsupervised learning was used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, it was found that using fewer features to cluster the data by K-Means resulted in tighter clusters.
